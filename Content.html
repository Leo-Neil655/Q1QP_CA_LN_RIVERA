    Summary: Most popular responses; Mathematics and Self-Study, Interesting Results: Difficulty in Filipino while English only takes up 1 percent, Overwhelming population preference for Self-Study with Online Resources and Tutoring being last<br>To be used for future reference in research</p></div>
    <div class="headert3ctb"><p>Conclusions (For histograms only): With the measurements for both being the unit of minutes, most people or approximately 45 responses stated they only study for 29.5 up to 60.5 minutes in the context of time for their hardest subject. The second quantitative variable being sleep duration, states that an overwhelming majority of the population sleeps in a total time of 283.5 minutes to 439.5 minutes, being in the center making the histogram centered. Converted into hours, that is approximately 4 and 3/4 to 7 hours, while also needing more sleep, is at least not too deprived or too much.<br>Summary (Overall): Possible future research could be expounded, connected to each other, with finding the best study method per subject, how to balance a schedule as much as possible for maximum efficiency without sacrificing personal comfort, parts of specific subjects that add complexity to the data and much more. It is advised to check the research paper for maximum information and analysis as this website serves as a mere preview.
